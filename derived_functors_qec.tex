\begin{abstract}
This paper introduces a novel approach to quantum error correction (QEC) using derived functors in homotopy theory. By mapping \((\infty,1)\)-spacetime configurations to \((\infty,1)\)-quantum states, our derived functor \( H(\infty) \) stabilizes physical content against local deformations and ensures robustness through homotopy-invariant corrections. We demonstrate how this framework addresses the challenges of singularities, anomalies, and topological features in quantum gravity, with practical implications for fault-tolerant quantum computing and dynamic spacetime environments.

\section{Introduction}
Quantum error correction (QEC) is central to the advancement of fault-tolerant quantum computing. Traditional methods focus on correcting local errors but struggle with nontrivial topological features and singularities inherent in quantum systems influenced by spacetime dynamics. This work proposes a homotopy-theoretic perspective to QEC by utilizing derived functors to emphasize robust invariants.

We define a derived functor:
\[
H(\infty): (\infty,1)\text{-Spacetime} \to (\infty,1)\text{-QStates},
\]
which enables systematic corrections for cohomological and homotopy-invariant data in quantum states. The implications of this framework include enhanced robustness to dynamic spacetime configurations and improved handling of anomalies and singularities.

\section{Homotopy Theory and Derived Functors}
Homotopy theory studies deformations of structures up to continuous equivalence, making it a natural candidate for robust quantum error correction. Derived functors extend this by capturing cohomological information in complex systems. By applying \( H(\infty) \), we connect geometric configurations with quantum states while preserving topological invariants.

\section{Applications to Quantum Error Correction}
Our framework offers several improvements over traditional methods:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Error Resilience}: Homotopy invariants ensure stability against local deformations.
    \item \textbf{Dynamic Environments}: Topological corrections maintain fidelity in dynamic spacetime configurations.
    \item \textbf{Higher-Dimensional Systems}: The \((\infty,1)\)-category formalism supports higher-dimensional quantum systems.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
The derived functor \( H(\infty) \) introduces a topological perspective to quantum error correction, addressing the limitations of current methods. Future work includes implementing this framework in practical fault-tolerant systems and exploring its implications in quantum gravity.

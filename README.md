# Derived Functors and Quantum Error Correction

This repository contains the accompanying code and documentation for the paper *Derived Functors and Quantum Error Correction: A Homotopy-Theoretic Approach*. 

## Overview

Quantum error correction (QEC) is essential for fault-tolerant quantum computing, particularly in dynamic spacetime environments. This project introduces a derived functor \( H(\infty) \), which stabilizes quantum states against local deformations using homotopy theory. The Haskell prototype demonstrates the mapping of spacetime configurations to quantum states with homotopy-invariant corrections.

## Features
- **Homotopy-Invariant Error Correction**: Ensures stability against local and global deformations.
- **Dynamic Configuration Support**: Handles evolving quantum systems in complex spacetime.
- **Higher-Dimensional Compatibility**: Suitable for advanced quantum gravity applications.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile and run the Haskell program:
    ```bash
    runhaskell DerivedFunctor.hs
    ```
